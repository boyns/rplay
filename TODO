rplay TODO - A random list of things that may (not) be fixed/changed/implemented.

* rplayd tends to peg the cpu when it is trying to connect to another rplayd.
  This needs to be fixed.

* Fix regex.[ch] to compile with a C++ compiler.

* Support more than one audio device in rplayd.  A client should be able to
  specify which device to use.  Should there be more than one audio spool?

* Add RPLAY_VOLUME_LEFT and RPLAY_VOLUME_RIGHT attributes.  RPLAY_VOLUME should
  still apply to both left & right.

* Use GNU rx instead of GNU regex.  Is rx faster?

* Add GNU readline support to the rptp client.

* rplayd needs to be updated to use the RPTP `set application=rplayd' command when 
  connecting to other rplay servers.

* Improve rplayd's RPTP error messages.

* Fix memory leak in lib/hash.c!

* Have rplayd play certain sounds at startup, shutdown, when a sound isn't
  found, etc.

* When clients tell rplayd to play a sound that's actually a directory, rplayd will
  of course not play the directory, but it keeps the directory in its sound list.
  rplayd should remove the directories from its list.

* Implement a C++ interface to the RPLAY and RPTP protocols.

* Stereo G.72x files don't work and I don't know how to fix 'em.

* Don't modify audio-port by default

* Java support?
