tkrplay is a Tcl/Tk sound directory browser.  Sounds are played, paused,
stopped, and continued using the rplay command.  Host volume setting is
done using the rptp command.  Both the rplay and rptp programs must be
installed somewhere in your PATH.

The RotateLeft button in the bottom left corner of the window will move
back to the previous directory.  The ! button in the botton right corner
will stop all sounds that are currently playing.

Tcl and Tk are available at ftp.x.org in the /contrib directory.
