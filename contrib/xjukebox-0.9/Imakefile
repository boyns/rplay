XCOMM These are the directories where the rplay files can be found :
RPLAY_LIB       = /usr/local/lib
RPLAY_INCLUDE   = /usr/local/include

XCOMM Uncomment and adjust these to change the destinations of "make install"
XCOMM and "make install.man" if the defaults are not satisfactory.
XCOMM BINDIR          = /usr/local/bin
XCOMM MANDIR          = /usr/local/man/man1
XCOMM MANSUFFIX       = 1

XCOMM It's not a good idea to change the default "app-default" directory.
XCOMM Chances are that "XJukebox.ad" and "XJukebox-color.ad" will simply be
XCOMM ignored if you uncomment and change the following line.  But you may
XCOMM change it if you can't install the files in their default directory.
XCOMM XAPPLOADDIR     = /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults

XCOMM How excited are you about debugging ?  This can be -g, -O, or nothing.
XCOMM CDEBUGFLAGS     = -g

XCOMM -------------------------------------------------------------------------
XCOMM Please don't change anything below this point - no need really - I hope.

           SRCS = xjukebox.c rptpstuff.c widgets.c

           OBJS = xjukebox.o rptpstuff.o widgets.o

        DEPLIBS = XawClientDepLibs
LOCAL_LIBRARIES = XawClientLibs -L$(RPLAY_LIB) -lrplay
        DEFINES = -I$(RPLAY_INCLUDE)

ComplexProgramTarget(xjukebox)
InstallAppDefaults(XJukebox)
InstallAppDefaults(XJukebox-color)

XCOMM You will only need the following lines if you change Xjukebox.ad and
XCOMM you want to hard-code the changes into xjukebox.  This is not needed if
XCOMM Xjukebox.ad is installed in the ".../lib/X11/app-defaults" directory.
XJukebox.ad.h: XJukebox.ad
	ad2c XJukebox.ad > XJukebox.ad.h
