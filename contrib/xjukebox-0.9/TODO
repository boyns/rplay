* Delay all other rptp commands when the spool is being updated.  Currently,
  the jukebox will crash if, for example, you choose "Get server list" when
  the spool is being updated.  A new RPTP command should only be sent if
  "rptp_mode" is equal to "MODE_IDLE".  This is the most annoying known bug.

* Keep the current selection in the spool list.  Each time the spool is
  updated, the current selection is lost.  This is a real nuisance, as the
  spool is updated every second...

* Fix the bug that smashes the default file name in the "Load list ..." and
  "Save list ..." menus entries.

* Implement "Sort by size", "Shuffle" and "Build list from directory".  These
  options have been temporarily removed from the menus.

* Use the "Multilist" widget (from the Free Widget Foundation) instead of the
  normal "List" widget.  Do something with double-clicks in the lists.

* Add some comments in the source files.

* Remove the debug messages.  Use popups for fatal error messages.

* Add a status bar, where all useful messages will be displayed.

* Add an "options" menu in the jukebox panel, with the following entries :
  "Set volume", "Set priority", "Set delay betweens sounds" ...

* Add a "repeat" or "loop" option.  (Keep the names of the files that are
  played and rebuild the list after the last one, or move the files to the
  bottom of the list as soon as they are played.)

* Add an "options" menu in the spool panel, with the following entries :
  "Toggle spool auto-update", "Set refresh rate", "Toggle host display",
  "Show access permissions".

* Add more comments in the source files.

* Add some command-line options (and the corresponding X resources).

* Change the colors.

* Add nice bitmaps for the buttons ("play", "stop", ... like on a CD-player).
