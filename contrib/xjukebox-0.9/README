README file for XJukebox 0.9
----------------------------

*----------------------------------------------------------------*
| This program is currently under development, so please send    |
| any questions, suggestions or bug reports concerning this      |
| application to : Raphael Quinet <quinet@montefiore.ulg.ac.be>. |
*----------------------------------------------------------------*

Please read the "TODO" file for known bugs and missing features.

Sorry, I didn't have the time to write a man page.  In the next release,
maybe...

To install, edit "Imakefile" (check the lines with RPLAY_LIB and
RPLAY_INCLUDE), then do the following :
	xmkmf -a
	make
	make install

I you notice some unusual problems, drop me a note and I'll fix them as soon as
possible.

Changes since last version (0.8) :
----------------------------------
- Rewrote all function declarations.  You should be able to use most C
  compilers with this version.  In 0.8, you had to use "gcc".  If you still
  have some problems with your C compiler (even unusual warnings), please
  report them to me.
- Added the "-jukeboxShown" command-line option, and the corresponding
  resource.  Not really useful, but at least your compiler won't complain
  about empty structs in "widgets.c".
- Added some lines in the TODO file, but nothing else in the source files :-).

Credits :
---------
  Thanks to Mark Boyns <boyns@sdsu.edu> for nearly everything.  ;-)

  Thanks to Patrick Atoon <patricka@sci.kun.nl> for his help about "cc"
compatibility.  I made a lot of silly mistakes in the function declarations !
