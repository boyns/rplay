rplaytool README


This is version 1.1 of rplaytool.  Many features of rplaytool
were inspired by XJukebox 0.9 written by Raphael Quinet
<quinet@montefiore.ulg.ac.be>.


FEATURES:

* Show sounds that are currently playing or paused.

* Allows sounds to be played, paused, continued, and stopped.

* Server volume control.

* Server sound browser/player (play with a double-click).

* Disk sound browser/player (play with a double-click).

* Maintain up-to 4 lists of sounds to be played sequentially.
  These lists are called playlists.

* Playlists can be saved and loaded using files.

* Uses RPTP asynchronous event notification and client-data to keep
state.


REQUIREMENTS:

* rplay 3.2 available at 
      ftp://ftp.sdsu.edu/pub/rplay/
      ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/audio/rplay/

* XView 3.x.  If you have Open Windows, you have XView.
  XView (X window-system-based Visual/Integrated Environment for
  Workstations) is a X Window System toolkit that is publicly
  available at ftp.x.org.

* SunOS or GNU `make'.


TODO:

* Support the RPTP `modify' command.

* Allow the user to specify sample-rate, count, volume, etc.

* Support flows.

* Implement shuffle.

The GUI interface to rplaytool was developed using the Open Windows
Developer's Guide (devguide).  Devguide is only required if you plan
on modifying *any* of the source code.
