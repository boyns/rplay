.SH NAME
rplayd \- rplay sound server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rplayd [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rplayd
is the sound server for the rplay audio system.  The server listens
for requests to play, pause, continue, and stop sounds using both the
RPLAY and RPTP protocols.  Normally RPLAY requests are received on
port 5555/udp and RPTP on 5556/tcp.  (Older ports 55555/udp and
55556/tcp are also supported)  Access to the server is restricted using
the
.I rplay.hosts
file.
.P
rplayd can be started during the system boot process, via inetd, or by
individual users.  root access may be required depending on audio
device permissions.
.P
In most causes rplayd will play sounds that are available on the local
disk.  However, rplayd can be sent sounds via the network and rplayd
can also contact other rplayds to share sound files.  The index of
all the local sound files is stored in
.I rplay.conf
and remote rplayds are specified in
.I rplay.servers.
Sounds received from other rplayds will be stored in a cache directory
normally located in
.I /tmp/.rplay-cache.
Cache entries are expired on an LRU basis.
.P
Many sound file formats are supported by rplayd.  These include:
.nf

    AU AIFF WAV VOC UB UL
    G.721 4-bit, G.723 3-bit, G.723 5-bit
    GSM

.fi
.P
Other formats can be played using external helper applications
which convert unknown file formats to CD quality data which
can then be played by rplayd.  See rplay.helpers(5)
.P
Several sounds can be played at once and sounds can be played at any
sample rate.  rplayd can be configured to output many different
formats using the various \-\-audio options.
.P
On some systems, namely Solaris and Linux, rplayd can read sounds
directly from CDROM using CDDA.  The special sound name
.I cdrom:
will play the entire CDROM.
.I cdrom:3-5
will play tracks 3 through 5.
