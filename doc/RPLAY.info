Overview
********

   The `RPLAY' protocol uses simple binary UDP packets to control the
audio server.  Communication between the client and server is one-way -
packets are sent to the server and the server *never* replies.

Commands
********

   `RPLAY' is based on a small set of commands which are used to
control the audio server.  These commands are:

`RPLAY_PLAY'
     Play a sound.

`RPLAY_STOP'
     Stop a sound.

`RPLAY_PAUSE'
     Pause a sound.

`RPLAY_CONTINUE'
     Continue a sound.

`RPLAY_PING'
     Wakeup the server.  This command was introduced to solve a problem
     with TCP clients that are trying to connect to a server that's
     started by inetd using a UDP port.

`RPLAY_RESET'
     Force the server to reset itself.  A reset normally involves
     re-reading all database files, closing all connections, and stops
     all playing sounds.

`RPLAY_DONE'
     Force a sound to be done.  In most cases this is the same as
     `RPLAY_STOP'.

Attributes
**********

   Most `RPLAY' commands use attributes to modify their behaviour.
These attributes are:

`RPLAY_COUNT'
     The number of times to play a sound.  The value should be between
     0 and 255 inclusive.  A value of 0 will play the sound forever.
     The default is RPLAY_DEFAULT_COUNT.

`RPLAY_LIST_COUNT'
     The number of times to play a sound list.  The value should be
     between 0 and 255 inclusive.  A value of 0 will play the sound
     forever.  The default is RPLAY_DEFAULT_LIST_COUNT.

`RPLAY_PRIORITY'
     The priority of a sound. The value should be between
     RPLAY_MIN_PRIORITY (0) and RPLAY_MAX_PRIORITY (255). The default
     is RPLAY_DEFAULT_PRIORITY (0).

`RPLAY_RPTP_FROM_SENDER'
     Tell the rplay server that it should try to contact the sender's
     RPTP server to obtain RPLAY_SOUND. This is only used if the rplay
     server does not already have the sound.

`RPLAY_RPTP_SERVER'
     Tell the rplay server which RPTP server should be used to try and
     obtain RPLAY_SOUND. This is only used if the rplay server does not
     already have the sound and RPLAY_RPTP_SEARCH is true.

`RPLAY_RPTP_SEARCH'
     Tell the rplay server whether or not it should search for
     RPLAY_SOUND.

`RPLAY_RPTP_SERVER_PORT'
     Tell the rplay server which port should be used to contact the RPTP
     server when using RPLAY_RPTP_SEARCH.

`RPLAY_SAMPLE_RATE'
     Play a sound at a specified sample rate.  A value of 0 will use the
     sound's default sample rate.  The default value is
     RPLAY_DEFAULT_SAMPLE_RATE (0).

`RPLAY_SOUND'
     The name of a sound.

`RPLAY_VOLUME'
     The volume of a sound.  The value should be between
     RPLAY_MIN_VOLUME (0) and RPLAY_MAX_VOLUME (255).  The default is
     RPLAY_DEFAULT_VOLUME (127).

Packet description
******************

   RPLAY packets always begin with a RPLAY_ID byte followed by a RPLAY
command. (*note Commands::.)  The remaining contents is a list of
attributes (*note Attributes::.) and their corresponding values.  The
packet is terminated with the RPLAY_NULL attribute.

   A packet will never contain an attribute that is set to a default
value.  This feature allows new attributes to be added without breaking
old servers and it also makes packets very small.

Here's an example packet:

     RPLAY_ID  RPLAY_PLAY  RPLAY_SOUND            RPLAY_NULL
     30        1           5            bogus.au  0

Note that numbers in RPLAY packets are stored in one byte and strings
are always null-terminated.  The above example in hexadecimal would be:

     1E 01 05 62 6f 67 75 73 2E 61 75 00 00
