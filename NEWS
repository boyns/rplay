Changes since rplay 3.3.1:

* Added devrplay.so which can be used with LD_PRELOAD to add rplay support 
  to audio applications use /dev/dsp.  devrplay is known to work with rvplayer,
  xmp, mpg123, freeamp, s3mod, esd (Enlightenment Sound Daemon) and even
  rplayd itself.  devrplay.so should be installed in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
  Example usage:

  bash$ LD_PRELOAD=devrplay.so rvplayer
  bash$ LD_PRELOAD=devrplay.so /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rvplayer/rvplayer
  bash$ LD_PRELOAD=devrplay.so dd if=/foo/bar/sound.wav of=/dev/dsp
  bash$ LD_PRELOAD=devrplay.so xxmp sound.mod
  bash$ LD_PRELOAD=devrplay.so mpg123 sound.mp3

  tcsh users will probably need to `setenv LD_PRELOAD devrplay.so; command'
  instead of using the `LD_PRELOAD=devrplay.so command' syntax.

  devrplay has only been tested on Linux, but it should be possible to
  get it working on other systems.

* Added rptp "set" command.  This can be used to set rplayd
  variables.  One important use of this is to set the audio-close
  variable.  Examples:

  Tell rplayd to close the audio device:
  $ rptp set audio-close 1

  Tell rplayd *not* to close the audio device:
  $ rptp set audio-close 0

* Added rplayd monitor support which allows rptp clients to monitor
  audio data that is written to the audio device.  rptp clients can
  now issue the "monitor" command to start receiving audio data.
  One use of this feature is to pipe the audio data to a program
  for visual display.

* rptp includes support for GNU readline and also displays progress
  information when doing get, put, and monitor.

* Fixed several potential rplayd buffer overflows.

Changes since rplay 3.2:

* Improved Linux support, including playing sounds directly
  from ATAPI CDROM.  Tested with the following:

      Linux 2.0.34
      Debian 2.0
      ESS ES1688 AudioDrive (rev 6) (3.1)
      TOSHIBA CD-ROM XM-1502B, ATAPI CDROM drive

  This also includes a new --audio-fragsize rplayd option.  See
  README.linux for more information.

* Support for external helper applications used to convert
  unsupported audio formats.  Helpers can be configured to
  support formats such as MPEG (using mpg123), modules
  (using xmp), and any other format that can be converted
  using a stdin -> stdout filter.

* --fork and --no-fork rplayd options.  When not in debug or inetd
  mode, rplayd will fork to put itself in the background.

* rplayd is now installed in $prefix/sbin/rplayd instead of
  $prefix/bin/rplayd.

* Running rplayd from inetd now requires the --inetd option.

* --enable-rplayd-user=USER and --enable-rplayd-group=GROUP
  configure options.

* --user=USER and --group=GROUP rplayd options.

* Lots of bug fixes.
