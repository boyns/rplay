Changes since rplay 3.2:

* Improved Linux support, including playing sounds directly
  from ATAPI CDROM.  Tested with the following:

      Linux 2.0.34
      Debian 2.0
      ESS ES1688 AudioDrive (rev 6) (3.1)
      TOSHIBA CD-ROM XM-1502B, ATAPI CDROM drive

  This also includes a new --audio-fragsize rplayd option.  See
  README.linux for more information.

* Support for external helper applications used to convert
  unsupported audio formats.  Helpers can be configured to
  support formats such as MPEG (using mpg123), modules
  (using xmp), and any other format that can be converted
  using a stdin -> stdout filter.

* --fork and --no-fork rplayd options.  When not in debug or inetd
  mode, rplayd will fork to put itself in the background.

* rplayd is now installed in $prefix/sbin/rplayd instead of
  $prefix/bin/rplayd.

* Running rplayd from inetd now requires the --inetd option.

* --enable-rplayd-user=USER and --enable-rplayd-group=GROUP
  configure options.

* --user=USER and --group=GROUP rplayd options.

* Lots of bug fixes.
